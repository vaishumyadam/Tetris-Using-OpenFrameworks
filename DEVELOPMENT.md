11/17/19:
- Spent too much time trying to clone the project
- Created new classes and tried to use images for the tetrominos and the board of the game
- After realizing that the image approach won't work, I deleted those classes
- Started new approach of using a block class with a given position
- Created the block, board, and tetromino classes to map out the game algorithm

11/18/19:
- Worked on the block class by giving it variables and methods
- Created a new Pieces class to create the tetrominos that are actually going to be falling
- Worked on board class by adding methods
- Completed a few methods that together delete the line at the bottom when it has a tetromino in every block

11/19/19:
- Researched on what kind of shapes are traditionally used in tetris: S-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, L-shape, Line-shape, Mirrored L-shape, and a Square-shape
- Figured out what colors I am going make the background (pink) and each of the [pieces](https://colorswatches.info/shades-of-white).
- Researched and downloaded what sounds I will be using for the external library part of the project: falling tetromino (fall.wav), losing end screen (gameover.wav), clearing a line at the bottom (line.wav), winning end screen (success.wav), moving the tetromino left or right (clear.wav), rotating the tetromino (selection.wav)
